## REST API Concept
The production endpoint for the Partner API is currently **https://base.shopjimmy.com/api/partner/v1**

Access to the api requires an application to be approved, followed by an account installed on our server.
Once approved, you will be given a client_id and client_secret, and you can start developing against our development endpoint.

### Shipping 
You are to provide access for our carrier accounts to ship using your accounts. 
You will provide a shipping service name and carrier per order request.
---

---
### Billing
All orders fulfilled will be invoiced electronically at a later date.
Each order will reference your api account info for the billing address of each order.
