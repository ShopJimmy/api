## API Authentication

To get an order's status using the Partner API, include the Authorization header in your HTTP request. 
The Authorization header should contain a Bearer token, which is necessary to authenticate your search requests.

## Usage
This action will show you an order's various timestamps of events, and also any packages that have been shipped including the items within.
You will only be able to see orders that you've placed with your partner account.
